[After three days...]

RITA (COM): Ananth, come back to me whenever you're free. I got a lead.



INT. RITA'S LAB

RITA is sitting down with a cigarette, bleeding, and a man is tied and gagged in the corner of her room.

RITA: (holding a paper) You feel like taking a trip to Cor'deve?

ANANTH: The city of gangsters and slavers that all hate us?

RITA: Yeah.

ANANTH: I'm game.

RITA: Apparently, someone's found an artifact capable of tracing the movement of energy through Haven. If we had _that_, we could follow the energy from the Core and see just where the hell it's going. That should lead us to the Thing.
RITA: Trouble is, Lady Jezebel was the last to have it. So, off to Cor'deve we go.



INT. AIRSHIP

The airship to Cor'deve is luxurious. The dining room looks more like a party, complete with flight attendants serving alcohol and hors d'oeuvres.

RITA: Champagne?

ANANTH: ...Rita? What are you doing here?

RITA: You thought I was going to miss out on _this_?
RITA: Dear brother, you have no idea what you're walking into. Unlike me. I know how Jezebel thinks, and I know how to get around her defenses. I also know how dangerous she can be -- so believe me, I'd be an idiot to let you go in alone.

ANANTH: But why are you dressed as an attendant and why are you so...

Rita picks her teeth.

ANANTH: ...fleshy?

RITA: Because I don't want anyone to recognize me in case they stick a knife in my back, and, half the guys here are prime for some blackmailin'. I'm going to get some photos toni-i-ight.

ANANTH: Aren't they going to recognize me, too?

RITA: Nope. Your name isn't officially on the registry, and nobody knows you're here. I made sure they mistook you for Alicia Morvarth, a wealthy performance artist who was already on the list. Here's a poster.

She passes him a poster.

ANANTH: This is a woman.

RITA: Eh, you albinos all look alike.

ANANTH: But she's supposed to be on this flight, right? Where is she?

RITA: Threw her off the docks. 
RITA: If you'll excuse me, that banker seems to be drinking alone. Time to help him discover his prostate.

ANANTH: ...Have fun.


EXT. COR'DEVE

Ananth and Rita step off the airship onto a lavish dock.

* ["So, what's the plan?]
    RITA: Ideally, Jezebel gives us what we want out of mutual respect, and an understanding that it's the end of the world. 
    RITA: Our job, essentially, is to head off any attempts at betrayal. Which is easier said than done. 
    RITA: Don't eat or drink anything. Don't let yourself be led anywhere. If they offer we stay the night, decline, and we'll hide in the Warrens.

SERVANT
Madame Kordo?

RITA
That'd be us.

SERVANT
Right this way.

* ["All right, explain.]
    RITA: (fanning herself) I booked us for an audience with Jezebel under the name of 'Kordo'. 
    RITA: There's been a few impersonators to our names over the years, so, she likely wouldn't receive us if I put us down as 'Ananth and Rita'.
    
    ANANTH: Okay. So who's Kordo?
    
    RITA: A slave boy she had killed right in front of me. Inside joke. 
    RITA: Wait, what do you call an inside joke that isn't funny?

* Ignore it.

-
SERVANT: Lady Jezebel was expecting an entourage. Shall we wait?

RITA: That won't be necessary.

ANANTH: (whispering) ...Entourage?

RITA: Bodyguards.

* ["Why _don't_ we have bodyguards?]
    RITA: (fanning herself) We do. They snuck into the manor yesterday. I'm not advertising the help in advance.

* ["Well, we don't need 'em.]
    RITA: (fanning herself) Actually, we do. They snuck into the manor yesterday.
    
* [Defer to Rita.]
    RITA: (fanning herself) Can't let them know we have them. So I had them sneak into the manor yesterday.

EXT. MANOR JEZEBEL - ESTABLISHING

An iron gate opens, revealing the path to Manor Jezebel. Slaves tend the gardens outside. A doorman stands outside front doors made of white wood.



INT. MANOR JEZEBEL, LOBBY
The lobby is extragavant, tall, and circular. Everything is white and gold, from the wallpaper, to the carpet, to the trim of the drapes.

SERVANT: She will be with you momentarily.

RITA: Excellent.

    Rita inspects the mints carefully.

    She pours them out into her purse. <>

Ananth looks at something off camera.

ANANTH: That woman has no clothes on.

RITA: It happens.

SERVANT: My lady, Madame Jezebel has arrived.

The doors at the top of the stairs open to a chorus of string instruments. She does a dramatic flourish and opens a paper fan.

JEZEBEL: Rita! Darling!

RITA: Jezebel.

-> dinner


= dinner
ANANTH: (whispering) Where are the bodyguards?

RITA: {not execution: I don't know. | I-I don't know...}

JEZEBEL: This manor is as old as Cor'deve itself. Once, it was the yurt of our founding chieftain. He was the one who stopped here, on this Fragment, and forged an alliance with the Conclave ae Scolia. From there, Cor'deve began to blossom into the city you see today. The knowledge of the Progenitors and the spirit of the Draive, woven into one.

ANANTH: And where does crime and slavery fit into that?

JEZEBEL: Slaves? We don't have slaves, here. 
JEZEBEL: I provided these men the opportunity to pay off a debt, and they accepted! It's a generous arrangement for us both, I assure you.

ANANTH: Was Rita given an offer?

JEZEBEL: You should ask her.

RITA: ...

JEZEBEL: As for the crime...
JEZEBEL: Yes. For every right you claim, a law must be imposed... and for every law that's broken, another claims a right. Freedom is a zero-sum game, and our people are nothing if not freedom-seeking.
JEZEBEL: Do you disagree?

* ["It isn't that simple.]
    JEZEBEL: But it is! Say you demand property rights. A man could starve right outside your shop, and it would be perfectly legal to watch him die, as would any shrewd businessman. And if that man decided to steal from you, the Delgorens would have him thrown in jail. In Cor'deve, we'd invite him to try.
    
    ** ["The Delgorens would also make sure the man was fed.]
        JEZEBEL: (fanning herself) My child, do you really think nobody starved in Delgoren society? 
        JEZEBEL: Oh, believe me, if a fair and just society existed where everyone got what they deserved, I'd love to see it. For now, you're what you're talking about is fantasy. Nothing more.
        JEZEBEL: Let's concede to fantasy, however. Even if the laws _could_ be made fair and just for everybody, people are all different. Someone could come to my husband's funeral to protest his religion -- freedom of speech, right? I, of course, would feel compelled to punch him in the jaw.
        
        RITA: You've never had a husband.
        
        JEZEBEL: Not the point. I'm asking you, who do you think has the law at their side? The rich? The productive? Surely, it's not the beggar who can barely string a sentence together...
        JEZEBEL: The Delgorens thought they could _make_ people uniform through strict adherence to their bloody religion, but there were always dissenters. The Delgorens treated them like criminals. And that's why so many of us fled their so-called 'perfect society'.
        
    ** ["What if I didn't want to have to steal?]
        JEZEBEL: Then don't. Die in the streets.
    
* ["I don't know. Sounds fair.]
    JEZEBEL: I'd expect nothing less from the spawn of Agatha.

* ["I didn't come here to debate philosophy.]
    JEZEBEL: Ah! Of course, you're right.

-
JEZEBEL:    Your colony is still young. You have yet to stop and really think about what you're trying to accomplish. When you do, perhaps you'll arrive at the same conclusion as us. After all, both of us escaped from the depths of slavery. In our hearts, you believe what we believe -- that the only thing a person should be concerned with, is their own happiness.
JEZEBEL:    Rita, please stop making that gesture.

RITA:       (making a stroking gesture) What gesture? 
RITA:       Oh, this? This is Fol'devean for 'tell me more'.

JEZEBEL:    Well, I do hope you've saved your manners for dinner.


INT. MANOR JEZEBEL, DINING HALL

Six men are tied to their chairs and gagged, surrounding a long dining table.

RITA (taken aback) ...

JEZEBEL: I discovered these gentlemen hiding amongst the servants. Ruthless killers, the lot of them. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?

One of Jezebel's guards points her gun at the back of a bodyguard's head.

    RITA: Oh, God... 
    RITA: Okay. Once upon a time, I was young, and stupid. Stupid me heard about an important artifact in Jezebel's collection, and decided to try stealing it. 
    RITA: I was caught. If I hadn't told her who I was, she'd have me tortured for weeks before killing me.
    -> dinner_rita
* ["So what did she do to you?]
    RITA: What _didn't_ she do? 
    RITA: I was her pet, and her prisoner. She alternated between pampering and tormenting me on a whim, and you can see how whimsical she is. 
    RITA: She tortured people in front of me, made me listen to her rants, said things that twisted my mind in knots... I think she saw herself as a strange, twisted mentor, if only because she wanted me under her thumb. 
    RITA: You know what's screwed up? I secretly thought it would be fun, seeing her again. That's how much she got to me. Somehow, I look back on her like an old friend.

    RITA: ...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stressed. This isn't going well. Whatever she's doing, it's bad news.

RITA: ...

She grabs the guard's leg, and zaps him. He writhes and falls to the ground, unconscious.

RITA: Like hell I wasn't going to come in here without protection. 
RITA: Come on. We'll find that artifact and get out.

There's only one other door out that isn't locked. It takes Ananth to...


INT. MANOR JEZEBEL, HALLWAY

The door flings itself out of Ananth's hand and locks behind him before Rita can come through.

ANANTH: It's locked!

RITA: _Dammit all!_ 
RITA: Okay... I'll hide the body, and you clear the way to the storage room. I'll be behind you as soon as I-- 
RITA: ...Oh, shit. Ananth, run. Get out of here, _now_!

A turret pops out and starts firing on Ananth, forcing him out of the hallway. Most of the doors are locked.

Ananth opens the only door he can, and gets knocked out.


INT. MANOR JEZEBEL, CELLAR

ANANTH: ...Where am I?

The cellar is pitch black.

RADIO: Hello, contestants!

The lights come on, revealing the cellar. It's bloody, showing signs of a horrible struggle.

RADIO: Congratulations -- you're on One Night With Madame Jezebel!

A live audience cheers in the background.

ANANTH: (whispering) Oh, hell no.

RADIO: Contestant number one is the administrator of Fol'deve. She and Jezebel have a long history, but had something of a falling out years ago. Now she's back, and she needs something. How many skeletons does _she_ have buried, I wonder? Let's find out! 
RADIO: Contestant number one, what's your name?

RITA (COM): Rita.

RADIO: Give it up for Rita!

A live audience cheers in the background.

RADIO: Contestant number two is known by some as the 'Arv'mahdant', the holiest figure in Arv'nogktism. He has a whole cult worshipping the ground he walks on. But how holy is he, really? Let's find out! 
RADIO: Contestant number two. What's your name?

RADIO: Now, Ananth, I know you're from little old Fol'deve... Tell me, have you heard our show before?

ANANTH: No.

RADIO: Well, let me break down the rules for you! 
RADIO: One Night With Madame Jezebel is a real up-and-coming game show from your friends at Nightline Six, Cor'deve's number-one provider for radio lines and related services! 
RADIO: The rules are simple. Survive three rounds, and you get a fabulous prize!

ANANTH: Is it my life?

Laughter comes from the radio.

RADIO: No, silly! Everyone goes to Madame Jezebel for something or another. All you have to do is survive, and you'll get whatever you came for! 
RADIO: Luckily for you, we know exactly what you're here for!

RITA (COM): _We'll find that artifact and get out._

RADIO You'll get your life back as a fun bonus. 
RADIO: Everyone, give it up for Ananth!

The live audience applauds.

RADIO: Each round, you will be given a question. Then, you'll have to face a deadly challenge. Answer the question correctly, and we'll go easy on you! Maybe. Answer wrong, and we'll make things _much, much harder_. 
RADIO: The jewelery you were given can detect any lies, so answer carefully! 
RADIO: ...And since we've got two contestants this time, we'll have a bonus game for you at the start of each round! Isn't this exciting?

    ANANTH: You realize I _can't_ die, right?

    RADIO: Of course! Don't worry -- we've got something special in store for you!

    RADIO: More than three, less than six!
    
    ANANTH: Why so ambiguous?
    
    RADIO: Oh, you'll see. Or, maybe you won't. Rita can explain to you after you're done, I'm sure. Assuming she survives.

A dramatic stinger plays on the radio.

RADIO: First question! We noticed that {prologue_lostear: you're missing an ear|your eyes have some sun damage}, and you haven't fixed it yet! Is it because... you can't?

* [Say nothing.]
    RADIO: Ananth has chosen to remain silent! But we know the truth.
* ["I just haven't done it yet.]
    RADIO: That's a lie!
* ["Yes, I can.]
    RADIO: That's a lie!
* ["No, I can't.]
    RADIO: Correct!
    
    A chime plays.

-
RADIO: If you get incapacitated during any of our challenges, we're going to remove something! Could be an eye, could be a hand... whatever it is, you sure will miss it! 
RADIO: Proceed to the first challenge!

The door out opens.

// Possibly have a way to recover major injuries later? The only injury before this would be the light sun damage to Ananth's eyes and maybe his ear, which isn't a big deal.

RADIO: All right, it's time for Round Two! Since we've got two contestants, we're going to play a bonus game. You know what we're talking about! Everyone put your hands together, for...

AUDIENCE: Trust Chamber!

They applaud.

RADIO: That's right! Contestants, this time you'll both be answering questions about the other person! As always, silence _is_ an option! 
RADIO: If you both betray each other and answer honestly, you'll both face a slightly harder challenge this round. On the other hand, if you both remain silent, the next challenge will remain unchanged. 
RADIO: ...But, here's the fun part. If you remain silent, and your partner answers our question, _they'll_ get to skip this round altogether, and _you_ will have to face a much, _much_ harder challenge. 
RADIO: Say hello to the other contestant!

RITA (COM): Ananth, listen to me, I'm--

She gets drowned out by applause.

RADIO: All right, it's game time! Choose wisely!

}

ANANTH: Wh... what?

RADIO: It looks like Rita has chosen to betray her brother. Ananth, please proceed to the next challenge! Rita, _you_ get to spend this round in the spa. Congratulations!

// The spa should be appropriately luxurious. With a slave boy doting on you hand and foot, making Ananth hella uncomfortable. Just for fun, he should also congratulate you for being so conniving. A radio can play the feed from Rita's challenge.

RITA (COM): Bite me.

The door ahead opens unceremoniously.

// Rita's choice is dependent on her relationship with Ananth, but she's currently wounded and can't handle another challenge.

// Questions to ask Rita: 'Did Ananth really kill Agatha?' (he didn't). 

JEZEBEL (COM): People are so messy, aren't they?
JEZEBEL (COM): You know why I love this game? Because it really helps you appreciate what goes on in another person's mind when you have no control over them.
JEZEBEL (COM): Take away all the social constraints, and face it -- you don't know what's going on in her mind. All you have to do to 'win' is trust each other, but you can't.


INT. MANOR JEZEBEL, QUESTION ROOM 2

RADIO: Second question.

A dramatic stinger plays.

RADIO: Ananth. Several years ago, your sister went missing for several months.
RADIO: You must have heard that she last went to Fol'deve... yet, rather than help her, you elected to remain in the shelter. Why?

* [Say nothing.]
    RADIO: Ananth has chosen to remain silent! The next challenge will be a little more difficult.

Next it's a slide puzzle, with the size varying by difficulty. Every turn causes Ananth to take damage.

Afterward, a note falls from a grate in the ceiling.

ANANTH: ...This is Rita's handwriting...

"I'm sorry. I was horribly wounded during the last round, and the next challenge would have killed me. If we keep betraying each other, Jezebel will win. She wants blackmail. No matter what, be silent during the next question. I'll do the same. "

RADIO: Ananth. Last week, a Delgoren chapel was bombed in the Warrens of Tengloc'an. Its priests were non-combatants who only wanted to ease the extreme poverty in the area. Some are saying that Rita was responsible for this heinous act. Was she?

RADIO: Let's hear what your opponent said... 
RADIO: Rita. There are rumours that Ananth regularly attends brothels, specifically those owned by your mutual friend, Mav, a notorious pirate. Is this true?

RITA: That--

Beat.

RADIO: Shall I take your silence as--

RITA: Ananth, if you're listening to this, I'm--

She gets zapped, and cries out in pain.

RADIO: Are you answering the question, or no?

RITA: ...I'm not falling for this. You people know better.

RADIO: I'm not sure, Rita -- this rumour's gotten a lot of traction. Is it true that he prefers the company of men?

RADIO: Rita. Last question.

RITA: ...Wait.

RADIO: Mm?

RITA: Was that _it_?

Beat.

RITA: Oh my God. This is too perfect.
RITA: I had this whole speech prepared! Jezebel's shown you Ananth is flawed. Good. We want you to know. If you want someone to judge your sins, which would you prefer, Cor'deve? Some faceless, heartless demigod who's never made a mistake in their life? Or, would you rather a human being who will _understand_ why you do whatever it is you do?
RITA: But this is even better! Because you've got _nothing_. You hear me, Jezebel? You can drag me through the mud all day long, but the Arv'mahdant is a sweet summer child, and you can't change that! He's untouchable, and now, the whole world knows!

RADIO: Last question.

RITA: Do your worst.

RADIO: Who killed Agatha?

Beat.

Rita gets shocked.

RADIO: Silence is not an acceptable answer! Who killed Agatha?

RITA: He did!

She gets shocked again.

RADIO: We know you're lying!

RITA: I'm not lying!

RADIO: Your vitals are off the charts!

RITA: Then _you're_ lying.

She gets shocked, over and over again.

RADIO: Who killed Agatha?

RITA: Stop--

She's shocked for several seconds.

RITA: Please...

RADIO: You are about to die. Who killed Agatha?

Beat.

RITA: ...I did.

A chime goes off.

RITA: He tried, but--

RADIO: But then... doesn't that make _you_ the Arv'mahdant, Rita?

RITA: No!

RADIO: Did you lie about all this, just so you could keep on sinning your little heart out?

Beat. 

RITA: (pained) I'm the administrator of Fol'deve. I have hard choices to make. I don't have the _luxury_ of living up to your impossible standards, so _go fuck yourself_.

Dear, dear... I don't know much about religious politics, but, seems to me this will be hard to recover from. / If you're going to have any chance of ruling after this, you're going to need some serious help. / What do you say? Ananth?

Ananth steals a sword from one of the suits of armour laying around. With that in hand, he goes into the off-limits areas of the manor.
The guards don't respond, at first. They tell him to leave, only to be cut down without warning. The others retaliate, and Ananth begins the slow work of carving a path through the hallways.
He fights his way to the storage room and finds the small wand that Rita had stolen from Jezebel years before, and given to Mav. He recalls that it can be used to generate a powerful magnetic field.
He rushes to the recording room, and activates it. It erases all the tapes in Jezebel's possession.
