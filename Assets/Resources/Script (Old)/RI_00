    Are you kidding? I'm fuckin' _chuffed_. / Look back across history at the sorts of people that get remembered. War heroes, politicans, mass murderers...
    
    ANANTH
    Well, some of them--
    
    RITA
    No. They're a bunch of cunts, and I don't want to be in their company. / People say, well-behaved women rarely make history. Well, _fuck_ history -- everything good that's ever happened has been in the shadows. It's always the people in the background rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard work that heroes can't do.
    
    ANANTH
    You know, I'm... kind of in the 'hero' category, at the moment.
    
    RITA
    And God, do I feel sorry for you. / Agatha built this colony from the ground up, invested every bit of gold she could scrape together in its future, and what do people remember her for? A cataclysm that _probably wasn't even her fault_. / And you? People will remember you for killing your mother and being on the battlefield during the worst war in history. No matter how many lives you save, it'll always be a footnote. / Fuck history. The only legacy to be proud of is the one nobody remembers. So, let's focus on the real work, shall we?
