== ending_void

Agatha appears before the player in an endless, black void. It seems to ripple under her feet.

{
    -playthrough == 1: 
    AGATHA
    So this is the end.
    
    Beat.
    
    // I feel like she might actually be talking about preventing the suicide, making her the one to buy the world more time.
    AGATHA
    Romulus thought he could change history by killing you. What he didn't know -- couldn't have known -- was that I'd inserted myself at a critical moment in time. / Simply put... without me, there would _be_ no present, and therefore, any timeline where I die prematurely is void. / Elegant, isn't it? No matter what happens, there will always be an Agatha. The Designer can see no future without us present. I'm unkillable. / ...While you will fade from existence. / {
            -submit: This is what you wanted, right? To shepherd people into the void? / Were you expecting Paradise? Walls made of gold, and rivers beneath? / You wanted rest and comfort in God's embrace, and you've found it. / Look around, {player_name}. / This is your God.
            -else: I'm sorry.
        }
        
    Beat.
    
    AGATHA
    I guess there's nothing more to talk about. In another time, we might have had more to say to one another. But there's no point. / The Designer is gone. Nobody will remember what happened here. / So... this is where I leave you. / Another time, {player_name}.
                
    -else:
    AGATHA
    Here again... {submit: / Did you think it would be different this time? } / I admire your persistence. Perhaps, another time... / Or maybe you'll leave this world altogether? / Oh, well.
}
