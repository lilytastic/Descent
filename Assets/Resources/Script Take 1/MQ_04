…But this is pretty much the worst case scenario.

WREN
Yes. Luckily Ananth’s woken up, so we’ll have—

RITA
I doubt luck had anything to do with it.

ANANTH
Hey, what’s up?

RITA and WREN jump.

RITA
Ananth! We, uh…

RITA falters in her tone, searching for words. Something in her changes.

RITA
I’ve been pouring over this data over and over again since you connected me with the Core, and every time I reach the same conclusion. / The Core doesn’t create any power of its own. It siphons all its energy from the Night Sky and the Sea of Lanterns. That’s how I understand it, at least. / …But the energy usage is off the charts. I mean, absurdly off the charts. Do you have any idea how much energy just one of those Lanterns can burn, on average?

ANANTH
A lot?

RITA
Okay, so, one of the lights in this room will typically use 60 watts in an hour.

ANANTH
Yuh-uh?

RITA
The Progenitors believed the Lanterns each had enough fuel to burn through octillions of watts per second for billions of years.

ANANTH
Cool. What’s an octillion?

RITA
So, take the number 10.

ANANTH
Right.

RITA
Now add 27 zeroes to the end of it. / That’s an octillion.

ANANTH
So… a lot.

RITA
Right. / Well, Haven is using all of it.

Beat.

ANANTH
…What do you mean, it’s using all of it?

RITA
I’ll put it bluntly. / We have 25 days before all Lanterns in the Night Sky begin to die.

Beat. Countdown appears.

ANANTH
_What_—

RITA
—the _fuck_, right?

ANANTH
Is that normal?!

RITA
No! Nothing on Haven should need that much power.

ANANTH
So what could possibly be doing something like that?!

RITA
Some stupid thing with the energy intake of a quintillion lights!

ANANTH
So what do we do?!

RITA
Simple. We find _the Thing_.

*[“What do you mean, they ‘begin’ to die?]
    RITA
    If the current energy usage stops right this second, the Lanterns will eventually reach equilibrium and revert to their normal lifespan. Theoretically. / After 25 days, the Lanterns will become unstable, and the damage will be irreversible.
    
    -> rita_01

*[“What could this T/thing be?]
    RITA
    No idea. If it was an accident of the Progenitors, it’s been around for eons. The idea that we’re only discovering it 25 days before the damage becomes irreversible is… unlikely. / More likely is that someone created it very recently. As for the function, I honestly have no idea what could need that much energy.

…Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me.

CONSTANCE (O.S.)
As we speak, your armed forces are being turned to ash. I imagine you would all like to know why. / The past two decades, after the Cataclysm, we have only targeted the criminals and destitute among you. They now serve in Arv’vurdeve, safe and content. Now it is your turn – you, apostates of Fol’deve. / You’ve been told that Delgoren rule is cruel, and primitive. Yet you slave away in poverty, and for what? How many of you have wasted away from starvation? How many of you have watched your children die from disease? How many of you turned to crime just to survive, and where-oh-where was your Goddess of Ember then? / That heathen Goddess is the one who made this city for you. She took you from your home and gave you… what? A life without meaning. Would you rather work your fingers to the bone so that you can eat come winter? Or would you rather live by the generosity of the kindest of Masters, and build temples in the glory of God? / Your Goddess is dead. The Arv’mahdant has risen. The time has come to rise and take this city back from the oppressors. The time has come to rejoin Arv’vurdeve, and reclaim your rightful place at God’s feet!

The sounds of yelling rise from the streets below.

RITA
This probably wasn't the best week to cut rations.

CONSTANCE (O.S.)
Is this what you want, Arv’mahdant? This war? When the Day of Judgment comes, who do you trust to lead the faithful to their rightful place? Your sister?

Ananth, the lower classes are getting riled up. If we don’t end this quick, we might have a civil war on our hands.

Right up until you killed her, and gave everyone a taste for revolution. Your heart was in the right place, but when it comes to war… no side is ever without fault.

Not quite. No general is going to fight to the last man unless they absolutely have to, you dig? / This is a big game of tug o’ war.

    Good of you to protest. Having Constance on our side will end this war a whole lot quicker.

*["I thought you were all for killing Delgorens.]
    RITA
    Only to end the war! What do you think I am, a tyrant?

*["Very... shrewd.]
    RITA
    Yep, I'm a real shrew.

*["Thank God.]
    RITA
    God had nothing to do with it! What do you think I am, a tyrant?

*["Aw, I thought you were serious.]

INT. RITA'S LAB

Rita pops open a bottle.

RITA
Here's to a successful skirmish.

*["...]
    RITA
    What?
    You're not seriously conflicted about this, are you? Ananth, we just averted the colonization and enslavement of our entire race. Try smiling.

*["Is this really the time?]
    RITA
    Never stopped me before.
    
*["I'll drink to that.]
    RITA
    When the Delgorens catch us with our pants down, what do we do? We take our cock out and thump 'em with it.

She drinks.

RITA
It's almost enough to make you forget about the end of the world.

    *["What will the Delgorens do with Fol'deve?]
        RITA
        It'll be just another colony. / A good chunk of the men will be shipped off to Arv'vurdeve to help rebuild it. The rest will be kept here, as slaves. Those in the lower levels will have the same level of accomodation, but the upper classes will likely be moved out of their home, so the Delgorens can move in. / ...It won't be so bad. With careful administration, they could even be comfortable. If the Delgorens have good administration, that is.

    *["What about Wren?]
        RITA
        Wren is the Delgoren Matriarch. She's an apostate, in the eyes of the Old Del at least, but she's still a Matriarch. Not to mention she still has... special knowledge. / The Delgorens will keep her around as a trophy. A warning to any Delgorens that might question their legitimacy.

    *["Will the Delgorens back off now?]
        RITA
        Unlikely. That was a small army, more than I thought Constance would have with him, but it wasn't their entire force. / More likely is that Constance wanted to take Fol'deve bloodlessly. Now that that's failed, things are gonna get... difficult.
        -> all_endings
}

*["Is the poverty in Fol'deve really that bad?]
    RITA
    Fol'deve is a young colony. We have very little infrastructure, and the Delgorens sure as shit weren't helping these past few decades. / When we started, my job was to ensure food, shelter, clean water... everything we needed to survive. Ideally, everyone would get enough to live on, but the resources were scarce. With the Bank of Cor'deve blueballing us, I had to start selling supplies to the citizens rather than giving them away as I'd wanted. Those that didn't have the money... well, they'd have to wait. And then the prices just kept going up. / This problem would have been resolved right away if it weren't for the Delgorens breathing down our necks. What money I made kept getting earmarked for the next big siege, or to replace whatever airships we lost. I thought the people would understand why they were having to hold out for so long. Apparently not.

*["What's the plan?]
    RITA
    I'm going to get back into the game. If we're going to find the Thing, I need to reconnect with old contacts. If something was built recently that's big enough to use this kind of energy, someone out there has to know about it.
    
    ANANTH
    Wren didn't sound happy about it.
    
    RITA
    My old contacts are... not the best sort of people. Wren was the one who turned me legit. But unless someone has a better idea, we don't have much choice. / I'll get in touch with you when I find something. For now, try to get things under control. End of the world or no, this city's in shambles, and it could really use a goddamn hero.
