//EXT. NOX, HIGH BRIDGE # atmosphere: Steam at Night

52 AU, NOX

It is pitch black. An engine can be faintly heard in the background. 

The darkness splits in half as a steel hatch begins to open, revealing a cobalt sky and a thick cloud of steam. Agatha stands, silhouetted against the sky.
A guard stands outside with a flamethrower, and waits as Agatha steps out.

AGATHA: {~Easy on the old {~woman|lady}. I’ll move when I’m {~damned|bloody} ready.|Yes, yes, I'm getting up. {~Hold your applause.|Keep it in your pants.}}

We pan up to see Agatha’s face, as she looks out over the city of Nox. Over her shoulder, we see the skyline.

SMASH TO:


INT. COURTHOUSE 

The twin doors open with a heavy, metallic clang, operated by a lone officer. AGATHA and MELONIA are escorted in, still chained. The guard stands nearby with his rifle, but the women are allowed relative free reign of the room.

Romulus and Remus stand by the courtroom doors.

INT. COURTROOM

ROMULUS: The pre-trial has already been concluded. You two are here to give testimony, and fill in the facts we’ve not been able to find.

AGATHA: And just what is the point, if our guilt has already been determined?

ROMULUS: If you cooperate, perhaps we can work together to avert this crisis you’ve created.

AGATHA: It’s that bad, is it?

ROMULUS: Greater than you, me, and the entire Magistratum.

They are shown to the defendant’s podium, and sit.

Everyone but Agatha stands. The Judge glares at her.

AGATHA: I’m old. What part of ‘old’ do you people not understand?

>SMASH TO BLACK

The Judge bangs his gavel. #sfx:187705__odditonic__gavel-3-strikes-with-room-reverb

FADE IN:

Agatha is sitting at the podium.

JUDGE: Attach the lie detectors. #beat: 1

A guard attaches two devices to Agatha’s temples.

JUDGE: Agatha--

AGATHA: I don't believe we're on a first-name basis.

JUDGE: May I remind you that I'm the executioner for this case, Ms.--you don't even _have_ a last name.

AGATHA: So call me by my title. 'The Goddess of Ember'.

JUDGE: Okay, let's just get this out of the way. Does _anybody_ have further requests they'd like to make of the court before we begin?

{
    -mq00_meloniapresent:
        AGATHA: Melonia quite enjoys being called 'pet'.

The Judge pinches the bridge of his nose.

JUDGE: ...Would the prosecution care to begin? #beat: 1

/*
Romulus approaches and holds up Agatha’s silver locket, which is open to reveal a small, black marble.

ROMULUS:    This is yours, correct?

AGATHA:     …Correct.

ROMULUS:    What is it?

AGATHA:     Well, I’m not too sure myself. When I received it, it was called ‘the Seed’.

ROMULUS:    By who? Where did you get it?
*/

Romulus approaches Agatha with a stern expression.

ROMULUS:    There is a period of 25 years, between 28 BU and 3 BU, that we've so far been unable to investigate. What accounts exist are inconsistent at best. What we do know, is that the events were isolated to your homeworld, Haven.

/*
AGATHA:     Well, you're the time traveller. Why not just pop back there and see for yourself?

ROMULUS:    That's the mystery. All time travel to that period seems to be met with interference, the likes we've never seen before. Do you know anything about that?

AGATHA:     I'm not a time traveller. 

MELONIA:    ...I mean, we've dabbled.

AGATHA:     Only in the bedroom.
*/

AGATHA:     So, you just want me to fill in the gap for you? Is that it?

ROMULUS:    Precisely.

/*
MELONIA:    Ah, I wasn' _technically_ there...

JUDGE:      'Technically'?

MELONIA:    Why'm I on trial?

REMUS:      You're an accomplice in the greater scheme.

AGATHA:     And you just happened to snatch us both from our cottage. If you want to know _all_ the details, you should haul in my second-in-command.

ROMULUS:    She's deep in Bohemn territory. _You two_ were living in a small cottage in an isolated location.
*/

AGATHA:     (smirking) Well. 25 years is a long time -- and seeing as I don't know the nature of this case, I don't even know which parts are relevant...

ROMULUS:    So tell us everything, Agatha.

AGATHA:     _Goddess_, please and thank you.

ROMULUS:    Agatha. The punishment for your crime is _execution_, so whatever you tell us, it can only help your case. On the other hand, refusing to talk to us will shorten your remaining lifespan _considerably_, because if you couldn't tell, _time is of the essence_. _Do I make myself clear_?

/*
AGATHA:     Don't threaten me, little man.

ROMULUS:    Agatha, once you may have been the most powerful woman alive. Now, you have trouble walking. Perhaps it's time you outgrew your pride, along with these silly games.

Agatha pauses for a moment...

ROMULUS:    You seem far too excited about this.

AGATHA:     Do I?
AGATHA:     Well, I’m happy to tell you, but I’ll need your assurance that I won’t be interrupted.

ROMULUS:    I can’t give you that.

AGATHA:     You’ll need to. I told you, it’s a long story.

ROMULUS:    And how do I know you’re not playing games with us?

AGATHA:     Oh, I am _absolutely_ playing games with you.

JUDGE:      I must say, prosecutor, this seems... ill-advised.

REMUS:      Your Grace, this period is central to our case. The only one who can give us a reliable account, is Agatha. So long as she's wired to a lie detector, there's no harm in letting her speak for as long as she wants.
REMUS:      I say, let her play her games.

#beat: 1

ROMULUS:    (reluctant) Am I going to regret this?

AGATHA:     Oh yes. But your brother is right. You’ll need to hear this.

JUDGE:      Fine. You may begin your testimony.

AGATHA:     Excellent. 
//AGATHA:     We begin sixty years ago. If you're going to understand anything, you'll need to know about my son.

//MELONIA:    Oh God, it’s alrea’y funny.

// Should it be Agatha and Rita? Agatha was retired in an isolated location with Melonia, so that's why they were brought together...

AGATHA: I got it from my mother when I was 25. She told me it was the Seed of Our Destruction, and that I should keep it close to me at all times. She wouldn't tell me anything more.

# beat: 1

ROMULUS: ...Is that it?

AGATHA: Read the lie detector.

Romulus looks down at the display.

JUDGE: Let the record show that no signs of lying were detected.

ROMULUS: And was that the _whole_ truth?

AGATHA: I'm sorry, I thought time was of the essence. The whole truth is a story nested within stories -- stories about my children, my assassination, and my third- and second-greatest triumphs of all time. But, you wanted the short version, so there it is. That's all I know about the Seed.

ROMULUS: What does the Seed do?

AGATHA: I was never told. It could just be an heirloom, for all I know.

ROMULUS: ...Thank you, Agatha.

AGATHA: Goddess.


INT. COURTHOUSE

Agatha and Melonia are sitting outside.

AGATHA: I didn't think people would respect me after everything we've done, but I didn't think they'd pull me out of retirement just to put me on trial.

MELONIA: Wha' could we have done?

AGATHA: I don't know. I knew the Seed wasn't just a gem, but I didn't realize it would have such an important function...

MELONIA: You didn' _really_ tell 'em the whole story of how ya got it.

AGATHA: It was tempted. I'd love to have seen the look on Rom's face. I just didn't think it was worth the energy. They don't even plan on telling us what we _did_.

MELONIA: Yeah... They prolly just think we're two ol' ladies who need ta be locked up, 'fore we hurt ourselves.

AGATHA: Quite.
#beat: 1
AGATHA: You know what I think?

MELONIA: Wha'?

AGATHA: Fuck it. Let's kill 'em.

<- end_trial

AGATHA (O.S.): Do you want answers? Well, it's not that simple, and I don't say it because I want to torture you with pointless games...
AGATHA (O.S.): People are tricky. Manic, crazed, downright awful women included. If you don't take the time to sit and listen, you'll miss something, and you won't even know it.
AGATHA (O.S.): So please... when you're listening to someone, and you've hit the limit of your patience, just keep going, and see what happens.
